Subject: RDO Liberty released in CentOS Cloud SIG

I am pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Liberty for CentOS Linux 7 x86_64, suiteable for building private, public and hybrid clouds. OpenStack Liberty is the 12th release of the open source software collaboratively built by a large number of contributors around the OpenStack.org project space.

The RDO community project ( https://www.rdoproject.org/ ) curates, packages, builds, tests and maintains a complete OpenStack component set for RHEL and CentOS Linux and is a founding member of the CentOS Cloud Infrastructure SIG ( https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud ). The Cloud Infrastructure SIG focus on delivering a great user experience for CentOS Linux users looking to build and maintain their own onpremise, public or hybrid clouds.

In addition to the comprehensive OpenStack services, libraries and clients, this release also provides Packstack, simple installer for proof-of-concept installations, as small as single all-in-one box and RDO Manager ( https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO-Manager ) , OpenStack deployment and management tool for production environments based on OpenStack TripleO project.

-------
QuickStart:

Ensure you have a fully updated CentOS Linux 7/x86_64 machine, and run :
  sudo yum install centos-release-openstack-liberty
  sudo yum install openstack-packstack
  packstack --allinone

For a more detailed quickstart please refer to the RDO Project hosted guide at https://www.rdoproject.org/QuickStart

XXX: FIXME TBD link to RDO Manger docs?

RDO project is closely tracking upstream OpenStack project using the Delorean tool which is producing RPM packages from upstream development branches.

Since the previous OpenStack Kilo release, RDO is participating
in the Cloud SIG and using CentOS provided infrastructure.
Towards the end of developement cycle packages are imported into CentOS
Cloud SIG buildsystem and get eventually published in Cloud SIG
repositories.

Getting Help:

The RDO Project runs forums at : <URL?> and a q&a service <ask?>, for more developer oriented content we recommend joining the mailing list at <RDO LIST>. Remember to post a brief introduction about yourself and your RDO story. You can also find extensive documentation at <RDO Docs?>.

We also welcome comments and requests on the CentOS Mailing lists ( https://lists.centos.org/ ) and the CentOS IRC Channels ( #centos on irc.freenode.net ), however we have a more focused audience in the RDO venues.

To get involved in the OpenStack RPM packaging effort, see
http://beta.rdoproject.org/community/ FIXME when rbowen moves it to rdoproject.org today!
and https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud

Special thanks to all the folks who helped with last minute testing in
Freenode #rdo channel !

Thanks,
Alan Pevec, on behalf of RDO and Cloud SIG
