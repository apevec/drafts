Subject: RDO Liberty released in CentOS Cloud SIG

TEMPLATE https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/AnnouncingReleases

We are pleased to announce the Liberty release of RDO, OpenStack
distribution for Enterprise Linux operating system, in CentOS
Cloud SIG repositories.
OpenStack Liberty is the 12th release of the open source software for
building public, private, and hybrid clouds.
CentOS Special Interest Group for cloud infrastructure (Cloud SIG) is
a group within the CentOS community that focuses on packaging and
maintaining cloud infrastructure applications.

In addition to OpenStack services, libraries and clients, RDO Liberty
also provides Packstack, simple installer for proof-of-concept
installations, as small as single all-in-one box and RDO Manager,
OpenStack deployment and management tool for production environments
based on OpenStack TripleO project.

To install OpenStack Liberty using Packstack, on CentOS you can run:
yum install centos-release-openstack-liberty
and then follow RDO Quickstart instructions from Step 2: Install
Packstack Installer.

FIXME TBD link to RDO Manger docs?

** OPTIONAL explanation that rbowen asked for: what and where is what in RDO **
RDO project is closely tracking upstream OpenStack project using
the Delorean tool which is producing RPM packages from upstream
development branches.
Since the previous OpenStack Kilo release, RDO is participating
in the Cloud SIG and using CentOS provided infrastructure.
Towards the end of developement cycle packages are imported into CentOS
Cloud SIG buildsystem and get eventually published in Cloud SIG
repositories.
