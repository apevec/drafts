Subject: RDO Liberty and Fedora  - details for openstack-* maintainers


As a followup, here are few notes for the package maintainers, until rdo-packaging is updated with the workflow.

distgit will be rdo-liberty branch on github/openstack-packages/
Create it from Fedora master + git merge --squash rpm-master
git reset HEAD .gitignore sources .gitreview
git checkout .gitignore sources

Resolve conflicts in .spec file
Preserve Kilo patches(if any) and changelog
You might want to archive in ChangeLog.old like done for Kilo GA
