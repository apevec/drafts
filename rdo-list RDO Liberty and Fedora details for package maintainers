Subject: RDO Liberty and Fedora  - details for openstack-* maintainers


As a followup, here are few notes for the package maintainers, until rdo-packaging documentation is updated with this workflow.

distgit will be rdo-liberty branch on gerrithub/openstack-packages, create it from Fedora master and squash merge rpm-master:

git remote add -f gerrit ssh://review.gerrithub.io:29418/openstack-packages/$PROJECT # skip if already present
git-review -s
git remote add -f fedora git://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/openstack-$PROJECT.git # skip if already present
git branch rdo-liberty fedora/master
git checkout rdo-liberty
git merge --squash gerrit/rpm-master
git reset HEAD .gitignore sources .gitreview
git checkout .gitignore sources

Resolve conflicts in .spec file
Set correct Liberty Version: for your project
Release: field should be pre-release 0.N until GA
e.g. openstack-keystone.spec

%global release_name liberty
%global pypi_name keystone
%global milestone .0b3

%{!?upstream_version: %global upstream_version %{version}%{?milestone}}

Name:           openstack-keystone
Epoch:          1
Version:        8.0.0
Release:        0.3%{?milestone}%{?dist}

Get the source tarball for the current milestone e.g. milestone 3:
Source0:        http://launchpad.net/%{pypi_name}/%{release_name}/%{release_name}-3/+download/%{pypi_name}-%{upstream_version}.tar.gz
If Source0: is like above, rdopkg new-version --bump-only $UPSTREAM_VERSION should work.

Preserve Kilo patches if any: ideally, RDO packages are pure upstream and don't need any patches in RPM
-patches branches are as before in github/redhat-openstack/$PROJECT but since there isn't Fedora:OpenStack 1:1 anymore, branch name for RDO Liberty RPM patches will be liberty-patches.

You might want to archive old changelog entries in ChangeLog.old like done for Kilo GA
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openstack-nova.git/commit/ChangeLog.old?id=8945622d349ef552dbc182f60485f6807d7c8708
When done:
git commit -m "Update to Liberty"
git push -u gerrit rdo-liberty:rdo-liberty

For packages already in Fedora, build Liberty versions in Rawhide and ping apevec or number80 on Freenode #rdo for CloudSIG EL7 build.

If you get stuck, please ping us on IRC and/or reply to this thread!

Cheers,
Alan
